# NeuroVar: A Genetic Expression and Variation data visualization tool for Neurological diseases’ biomarkers

## Background

The expanding availability of large-scale genomic data and the growing interest in uncovering gene-disease associations call for efficient tools to visualize and evaluate gene expression and genetic variation data.  

## About NeuroVar
NeuroVar is a novel tool for visualizing genetic variation (Single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions) and gene expression data related to neurological diseases. The tool is available as a desktop application that does not require any computational skills to use.

The current version includes multiple neurological disorders  and diseases with neurological manifestations, including:

★	Epilepsy   ★	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ★	autism spectrum disorder   ★	intellectual disability  ★	brain malformation syndrome  ★	Syndromic Disorders   ★	Cerebral Palsy   ★	RASopathy    ★	Amnioacidopathy   ★	Peroxisomal disorders   ★	Hereditary cancer   ★	Mitochondrial disease   ★	Retina related disorders  ★	Hearing LossNeuropathy   ★	neurodevelopmental disorder   ★	fragile X syndrome  ★	frontotemporal dementia   ★	glycine encephalopathy   ★	Griscelli syndrome   ★	Joubert syndrome    ★	Microcephaly   ★	neurodevelopmental disorder   ★	neurofibromatosis   ★	Parkinson disease   ★	PHARC syndrome    ★	tuberous sclerosis  ★	neuroblastoma

## Implementation

The tool requires gene expression csv files and genetic variants VCF files, in the output style of the Exvar package.

## Operation

NeuroVar is platform independent.

All requirements are installed automatically.
