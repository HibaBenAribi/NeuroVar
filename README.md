## Background

The expanding availability of large-scale genomic data and the growing interest in uncovering gene-disease associations call for efficient tools to visualize and evaluate gene expression and genetic variation data.  

## About NeuroVar
NeuroVar is a novel tool for visualizing genetic variation (Single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions) and gene expression data related to neurological diseases. The tool is available as a desktop application that does not require any computational skills to use.

The current version includes :

* 11 Neurological Syndromes are integrated, including:

              ★ Epilepsy 
              ★ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
              ★ Intellectual disability and Autism spectrum disorder 
              ★ Brain malformation syndrome 
              ★ Syndromic Disorders 
              ★ Cerebral Palsy 
              ★ RASopathy 
              ★ Aminoacidopathy 
              ★ CranioFacial Malformations 
              ★ Parkinson disease 
              ★ PHARC syndrome 

* and 7 Non-Neurological diseases with neurological manifestations are integrated, including:

              ★ Peroxisomal disorders  
              ★ Hereditary cancer 
              ★ Mitochondrial disease 
              ★ Retina-related disorders 
              ★ General Gene Curation
              ★ Hearing Loss 
              ★ Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders
